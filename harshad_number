"""
A harshad number (or Niven number) is an integer that is divisible by the sum of its digits. 
For example: 
Input: 18 
Output: true (18 is a Harshad number because it is divisible by the sum of its digits: 18 = (1 + 8) x 2) 
Input: 1729 
Output: true (1729 is a Harshad number because it is divisible by the sum of its digits: 
1729 = (1 + 7 + 2 + 9) Ã— 91) 
Write a program to check if the user input is a Harshad number or not.
